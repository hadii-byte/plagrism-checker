# plagiarism-checker
Plagiarism checker built using Tkinter is a useful tool for detecting instances of plagiarism and ensuring the originality of written work. The user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to upload and analyze documents, while the advanced plagiarism detection algorithms provide accurate and reliable results.
This program implements a plagiarism checker using Python and Tkinter. The program provides a user- friendly interface for users to select two files, compare them for similarity, and view the similarity percentage. The code uses the filedialog module to allow users to select the files they want to compare. The clean_text function is used to remove punctuation and whitespace from the text of the selected files to make comparison more accurate. The view_file_content function displays the content of a selected file in a new window. The compare_files function compares the text of the two selected files and calculates the similarity percentage using the cosine similarity method. The Tkinter module is used to create the user interface of the program. The code creates labels, entry widgets, and buttons to allow users to select files, view their contents, and compare them. Finally, the code creates a label to display the similarity percentage result
